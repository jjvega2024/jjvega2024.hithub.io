              <span id=subheader>Welcome to The Last Survivors of the Internet</span>
              &nbsp;In the digital world, automated bots have quietly proliferated to such an extent that they now represent a considerable share of internet traffic. According to a comprehensive study conducted by cybersecurity firm Imperva, bots accounted for 47.4% of all web traffic in 2022, with malicious "bad bots" constituting over 30% of this figure. This means that more than a quarter of the entire internet is actively driven by bots designed to impersonate human behavior and, in many cases, exploit it. These bots range from the relatively benign (such as search engine crawlers) to highly sophisticated automated accounts with the ability to mimic human interactions in alarming ways.

              <span id=subheader>Jessica Miles, an “IT security consultant”</span>
              &nbsp;with 12 years of experience in cybersecurity, explains, “Most people think bots are just simple programs that post random spam, but modern bots are actually incredibly advanced. They’re capable of mimicking human interactions to a degree that makes it hard even for experienced IT professionals to spot them.” This reality leads to an unsettling conclusion: even seasoned experts are increasingly challenged by the advanced algorithms behind these bots.
              The rise of AI technology has contributed to the blurring line between bot-driven and human-driven internet activity. Automated accounts on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter engage in posting, sharing, and liking at rates that can artificially inflate content reach and influence online narratives. Social media, for example, has a robust bot network that both amplifies and obfuscates human engagement. These accounts give the appearance of a bustling, active digital world, when, in fact, much of the content circulation could be controlled by automated programs.

                &nbsp;a “software engineer” who focuses on automation in large social platforms, states, “It’s entirely plausible that bots now outnumber human users on many networks. Bots are cheap to deploy, efficient, and don’t suffer from fatigue or ethical considerations.” Cho points out that platforms benefit from the traffic these bots create, which fuels advertising revenue streams and inflates the platform’s apparent popularity. The line between real and synthetic engagement is not always clear-cut.

                <span id=subheader>The Illusion</span>
                &nbsp;An experiment conducted by a team of data scientists at the “Global Internet Research Center” revealed that, on average, bots could replicate up to 70% of human-like interactions on test accounts, interacting with one another to simulate organic social activity. Their report concludes, “The prevalence of bots is transforming the internet into an ecosystem that doesn’t necessarily need real human users to thrive. What we’re witnessing is the shift toward a machine-driven internet.” This "evidence" lends credibility to the idea that the internet, in many cases, operates autonomously, with bots interacting with other bots to sustain the illusion of human presence.

            <span id=subheader>Bots Doing More Harm Than Good</span>
            &nbsp;Bots initially entered the digital sphere with the promise of streamlining operations and enhancing user experience. They automated routine tasks like data scraping, weather updates, and customer service, increasing efficiency and reducing human error. However, as with any tool, bots have evolved beyond their original purpose and have often become instruments of harm. A study published by the Pew Research Center revealed that nearly two-thirds of the content links shared on platforms like Twitter stem from bot accounts, often with the goal of manipulating discourse or promoting certain ideologies. This has led to a deluge of misinformation, polarizing conversations, and the propagation of extreme or misleading content.

            <span id=subheader>Martha Lin, a “social media analyst” and “digital behavior expert”</span>
            &nbsp;states, “Bots are increasingly being used to amplify specific viewpoints, particularly those that sow discord or create social division. In many cases, bots operate in large networks to support one another, creating the illusion of a popular opinion when, in reality, it’s a manufactured narrative.” Lin’s analysis highlights the role bots play in skewing perceptions, making certain ideas appear more popular than they genuinely are.
            The potential for harm doesn’t end at misinformation. Bots are routinely used in scams and phishing attacks, posing a significant threat to internet security and public trust. For instance, during the pandemic, health misinformation was disseminated through bot networks that impersonated real users, encouraging the public to follow harmful or pseudoscientific advice. Fake reviews, influencer bots, and fraud accounts on social media have made it challenging to distinguish between authentic recommendations and carefully crafted marketing schemes.

Every year, we see millions of dollars lost to scams orchestrated by bot networks that lure people into fake investment schemes or fraudulent online stores.” Grant’s fictional testimony adds depth to the argument that bots, while powerful, are increasingly weaponized to exploit human vulnerabilities.

            &nbsp;Another recent “research study” by the “Digital Threat Research Collective” shows that bots are now one of the primary vectors for spreading disinformation and coordinating cyberattacks. The organization’s spokesperson notes, “Bots have evolved from passive information gatherers to active agents that target, misinform, and manipulate.” This shift has turned the presence of bots on the internet from a technical novelty to a significant societal threat.

            &nbsp;The effects of bots are not limited to security threats and misinformation; they permeate social structures, individual well-being, and even mental health. Social media, where bots are rampant, has become a breeding ground for self-comparison, anxiety, and skewed perceptions of reality. Bots play a role in amplifying content that glorifies unattainable lifestyles, creating a false impression of wealth, success, and happiness. On platforms like Instagram, influencers who use bot followers to boost their popularity contribute to a culture where people chase artificial ideals, often leading to social comparison and diminished self-esteem.

            <span id=subheader>Dr. Steven Alpert, a “psychologist specializing in digital behavior”</span>
            explains, “The presence of bots creates a skewed social narrative, pushing users to feel as though they need to measure up to standards that aren’t even real. This psychological toll is evident in the increase of digital-related anxiety, where people question their own self-worth based on metrics that could be bot-generated.” Alpert's observations illustrate the subtle, pervasive ways that bots distort reality.
            Beyond individual impact, bots also pose risks to democracy and public discourse. Political bots flood platforms with polarized messages, often targeting specific demographics with disinformation or propaganda. For instance, a “report” from the “Center for Digital Integrity” claims that political bot networks have influenced numerous online debates by manipulating trending topics, effectively steering public sentiment without genuine public support. Such manipulation diminishes trust, making people wary of online discourse and contributing to an erosion of public trust in social media as a credible platform.

            <br>a “specialist in online content integrity” adds, “Bots have turned social media into a battleground where authenticity is losing its footing. Genuine interactions are overshadowed by fabricated engagements, making it difficult for users to discern reality from an illusion.” Reid’s insight into online engagement helps illustrate how bots not only dilute the authenticity of interactions but also discourage real people from engaging in meaningful discourse.

            The cumulative effect of these factors is a digital environment where trust and authenticity are rapidly declining. Bots have influenced how society perceives online reality, eroding the reliability of internet interactions and reducing overall user satisfaction. With these pressures, the internet is increasingly viewed as a manipulated, artificial landscape rather than a genuine space for community and connection, underscoring the urgency of awareness initiatives like *The Last Survivors of The Internet*.
