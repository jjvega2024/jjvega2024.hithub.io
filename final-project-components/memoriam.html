          <span id=subheader>A Pioneer and Protector of the Digital World</span><br>

<br>In Loving Memory of Ethan McCallister:<br>

<br>It is with heavy hearts that we remember Ethan McCallister, a true pioneer and an unwavering advocate for truth in the digital age. Ethan was one of the first to recognize the dangers of the *Dead Internet Theory*, seeing through the noise of the online world and understanding the immense impact that bots were having on our interactions, privacy, and security. His passion for uncovering the truth and his dedication to protecting real people in a digital age plagued by artificial influences were unparalleled.<br>

<br>Ethan’s journey with *The Last Survivors of the Internet* began in its earliest days. He was not just a supporter of the project—he was a driving force behind its creation. As a seasoned web developer, he provided the technical expertise that helped lay the foundation for the site. His vision was clear: to create a safe space where people could learn how to identify and protect themselves from the bots that were silently infiltrating our online lives.<br>

<br>He believed that the internet should be a place for genuine human connection, and he worked tirelessly to ensure that others could experience that same sense of security. He was one of the first to publicly speak out about the growing presence of bots online, even when others dismissed the theory as nothing more than a conspiracy. To him, it wasn’t just theory—it was a reality that demanded urgent action. His insight and foresight were instrumental in developing the resources and tools that now help thousands of people recognize and avoid digital manipulation.br>

<br>Sadly, Ethan passed away from natural causes before he could see the full completion of his dream. But even in his final days, his focus remained on one thing: ensuring that *The Last Survivors of the Internet* would live on to protect those who needed it most. He expressed his final wish—to see the website finalized and launched, with its message reaching as many people as possible. It was a wish driven by love for the community, a deep care for the safety of others, and an unwavering commitment to the truth.<br>

<br>Today, we continue Ethan’s work in his honor. His legacy lives on in every part of this website—the resources, the tools, and the community he helped build. His dedication to protecting people online will never be forgotten, and we are determined to carry his mission forward.<br>
          
<br>Ethan’s work was never about recognition or fame. It was about making the internet a safer place for everyone. As we continue to share his vision, we hope to honor him by making sure his final wish comes true: that every person who interacts online can do so with the confidence that they are engaging with real, genuine people—and not hidden algorithms. Ethan may no longer be with us, but his spirit, his dedication, and his passion live on in The Last Survivors of the Internet.<br>

<br>Rest in peace, Ethan. Thank you for your vision, your friendship, and your tireless fight to protect the digital world. We will carry the torch for you.
