           <h2>Design Is Everywhere, But What Does It Mean To Create Good Design?</h2>
       </header>

       <p>Good design really does not need any explanation. Good design is a delicate balance of form, function and user-centered design principles. It is a combination of aesthetic appeal, practicality and accessibility that creates a beautiful and effective product. It is about creating solutions to problems, considering the user's needs (not always obvious or direct to the initially intended problem) and finding the best way to address them. Ultimately, good design should make our lives easier and more fulfilling. And once it becomes clear that the true goal of good design is to bring joy, show care and improve peopleâ€™s lives, all of us can start thinking differently and acting in ways that help us deliver that thrill.</p>

<p>Those of us in the tech industry hold incredible tools that can allow this to happen. I'm convinced that it is our responsibility. Having this at heart takes time and effort, but we should be determined to complete the journey. I invite you to do the same and demand the same from others. If we do so, we will be creating a better future for us all.</p>

           <h2>My Response to Design Is Everywhere, But What Does It Mean To Create Good Design?</h2>
       </header>

     <p>This idea of "good design" is very subjective as he says that good design is balanced, functional, and user friendly. There are tons of designs that are functional that aren't balanced visually, that are not user friendly but balanced and functional. To find this trifecta of the 3 is nice in a perfect world but doesn't mean it will visually look good. Good design in my eyes is something that makes the process easier but can also create a memorable experiece for the user. Whether that be through a poster, website, or sticker to name a few examples.</p>
       
       <p>You can maintain this idea of "good design" to help make users lives easier, but the lack of visual differentiation will become obsolete. People won't try to create new formats or layouts for designs that can push the quota because they want to stick with what's "safe" or "expected". If it isn't broke don't fix it may work for increasing efficiency and functionality but will leave us with wonder for what it could have become. Consistency is great, but it leaves out creativity.</p>
