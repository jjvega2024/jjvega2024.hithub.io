          <p>Starting off I really connected with her on how she had her first experiences on the internet with it feeling so mysterious and alluring to me as a child and even playing games like Neopets which I personally loved. </p>
          <bl>"Which is to say I witnessed it all, and as a particularly lonely child, I witnessed it rather closely: Neopets in elementary school, the birth of Myspace in middle school, the rise of Facebook in early high school, Instagram in late high school, the internet culture wars of infamy as a freshman in college, Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica in graduate school." &ndash;Kate Wagner</bl>
          <p> She expressed her distaste later on with how the internet evolved with a lot of it losing it's identity and ended up becoming this basic format for each and every website whereas with Geocities everyone had a unqiue website based on it's formatting, information, and of course visual style.</p>
          <bl>"In the age of smartphones and apps, our agency is only more limited; even what we see is limited, restricted by the proprietary designs of a small handful of companies. As for customization, it’s even worse: I can’t change how Twitter or Facebook looks on my phone. Hell, I can’t even undo what I just typed on my phone. This in part is because apps, though they may be connected to the web, are not websites." &ndash;Kate Wagner</bl>
          <p>Wrapping up the last parts, she talks about the different eras of the internet such as Vaporwave which gives callbacks to the old internet with that experimental and loose feel but then apps taking over with many getting optimized with their respective browser so either they were meant to direct you to the app OR many didn't get frequent updates getting left in the dust due to the push for mobile websites or mobile apps.
          </p>
          <bl>"Vaporwave was a new version of a recent past, a simulacrum; it was like a hitting “Save” instead of “Save As . . .” version of the 1990s—an overwritten file, a copy, but one for which no original exists." &ndash;Kate Wagner</bl>
          <p>Overall, I think her take on the internet is justified to an extent. The internet did lose a lot of it's personalized identity but didn't have much automation or security for it's users. So in turn, many grouped together to make microsoft for example that created security and structure to the internet but due to that, we lose that personality for many websites. So it's a give and take thing with each having it's pro's and con's and like she said at the end, hopefully we will get to see The Revenge of The Internet soon.
          
          </p>
          
          <bl>"It’s about time for a little revenge from the old internet. Or how about revenge from the older, older internet: communism. In the words of Marx: “All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify.” All that is solid melts into air, bitch." &ndash;Kate Wagner</bl>
